While tools like Mobalytics, OP.GG, and Porofessor provide in-depth match data and performance graphs, they often overwhelm casual or beginner players with raw stats, unclear metrics, or overly generic advice.

This project takes a different approach:

🧠 Actionable Feedback, Not Just Stats
Instead of displaying numbers, this tool gives you simple, human-readable advice like:

“You only placed 2 wards in a 30-minute match — try to aim for 1 every 3 minutes.”

🎯 Beginner-Friendly Coaching
Designed specifically for casual players looking to improve, the assistant avoids jargon and focuses on one or two key takeaways per match.

⚡ Lightweight & Web-Based
No installs, overlays, or noisy desktop apps. Just enter a summoner name and get clean, focused feedback in seconds.

🧩 Open-Source & Resume-Driven
Unlike commercial tools, this project is fully open-source and built to demonstrate backend engineering, API integration, and feedback logic — making it an ideal showcase for technical skills.

✅ In Short:
This tool is not trying to replace high-end stat dashboards — it's built to simplify performance insights, reduce learning friction, and help players improve in a way that's fast, fun, and easy to understand.
