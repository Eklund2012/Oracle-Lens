## Setup

Follow these steps to get OracleLens running locally:

### 1. Clone the repository

venv/Scripts/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Verify installation
You can check that all packages are installed correctly:
```bash
pip list
```

### 5. Run the bot
Make sure you have your environment variables set up (like your Discord bot token and Riot API key), then start your bot:
```bash
python main.py
```
