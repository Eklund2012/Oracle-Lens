# Privacy Policy for OracleLens

_Last updated: August 2025_

This Privacy Policy explains how OracleLens ("the bot") handles data when you use it on Discord.

---

## 1. Information We Collect
OracleLens may temporarily access the following data when commands are used:
- **Discord user input** (messages containing bot commands, e.g. `!lolstats`)  
- **Summoner data from Riot Games API** (summoner name, tagline, match history, profile information)  

No other personal information is collected.

---

## 2. How We Use Data
- Data is only used to fetch match statistics from Riot Games and generate visual summaries.  
- Data is **not stored permanently** â€” all data is processed in-memory and discarded after use.  
- Data is never sold, shared, or used for advertising.

---

## 3. Data Retention
- OracleLens does not maintain databases of user information.  
- Summoner data is retrieved only when requested via commands and is not retained after the bot responds.  
- Some data (e.g., cached champion versions from Riot API) may be stored temporarily to improve performance, but this does not include user-specific data.

---

## 4. Third-Party Services
- OracleLens relies on the **Riot Games API** for match and summoner data.  
- Use of the Riot Games API is subject to [Riotâ€™s Privacy Policy](https://www.riotgames.com/en/privacy-notice).  
- OracleLens runs on Discord and follows [Discordâ€™s Privacy Policy](https://discord.com/privacy).

---

## 5. Your Rights
Since OracleLens does not permanently store data, there is no data to access, correct, or delete.  
If you have concerns, you may stop using the bot and remove it from your server at any time.

---

## 6. Changes to This Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated occasionally. Continued use of the bot after changes are made implies acceptance of the updated policy.
